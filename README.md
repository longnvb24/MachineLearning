# 🧬 Breast Cancer Prediction with Machine Learning

## 📌 Introduction
This is a small project created after completing the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate**.  
The goal of the project is to **predict whether breast cancer is benign or malignant** using medical diagnostic data from the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset**.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle - Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data/data)  
- Number of samples: 569  
- Number of features: 30 numeric features  
- Target variable:  
  - **M = Malignant**  
  - **B = Benign**

## ⚙️ Project Workflow
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Descriptive statistics  
   - Checking for missing values    

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Standardize features using `StandardScaler`  
   - Split data into `train/test sets`  

3. **Model Building**  
   Algorithms applied:  
   - Logistic Regression  

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Accuracy
   - Confusion Matrix

## 🏆 Results
- Best performing model: **Logistic Regression Classifier**  
- Accuracy achieved: ~ **97%** on the test set

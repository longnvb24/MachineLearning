# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project applies **machine learning** techniques to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on passenger features such as age, sex, class, and family information. It is a classic beginner-friendly dataset from [Kaggle’s Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:

* Explore the Titanic dataset.
* Perform feature engineering and preprocessing.
* Train classification models.
* Evaluate and compare model performance.

---

## 🧾 Dataset

* `titanic.csv`: Training data with survival labels.
* Target variable: `Survived` (0 = Did not survive, 1 = Survived).

---

## 🚀 Models Used

* Logistic Regression
* Naive Bayes Classifier

---

## 📊 Results

* Logistic Regression: ~80% accuracy, balanced performance on both classes.
* Naive Bayes: ~77% accuracy, higher recall for non-survivors but weaker for survivors.

---

## 🔮 Next Steps

* Improve feature engineering (family size, titles from names, etc.).
* Handle class imbalance (SMOTE, class weights).
* Try ensemble models (Random Forest, XGBoost).
